# AppToken2FA

This is a clean, neat and elegant prototype for an Two Factor Authenticator App.
The purpose is to be able to control the access for multiple systems 
 
Do not communicate with any server, API or storage of any data. It is only a prototype with random data

## Features

- Collect from a server a new security code every 'X' seconds
- Be able to read a QrCode to check authorization, instead insert the collected code
- Configure and authorize the device
- Remove or reauthorize the device
- See all the authorized systems with some extra info
- Have a dedicated page for the app settings
